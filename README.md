# wwwBase

wwwBase is set up for [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

This is set up as I want to start my new pages and blogs. You are free to use it but I recomend using Lanyon default.

#### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: Om
next_page: /blog/
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


#### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.


#### Reverse layout

![Lanyon with reverse layout](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/98681/1825265/be03f2e4-71b0-11e3-89f1-360705524495.png)

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```


#### Sidebar overlay instead of push

Make the sidebar overlap the viewport content with a single class:

```html
<body class="sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

This will keep the content stationary and slide in the sidebar over the side content. It also adds a `box-shadow` based outline to the toggle for contrast against backgrounds, as well as a `box-shadow` on the sidebar for depth.

It's also available for a reversed layout when you add both classes:

```html
<body class="layout-reverse sidebar-overlay">
  ...
</body>
```

#### Sidebar open on page load

Show an open sidebar on page load by modifying the `<input>` tag within the `sidebar.html` layout to add the `checked` boolean attribute:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" checked>
```

Using Liquid you can also conditionally show the sidebar open on a per-page basis. For example, here's how you could have it open on the homepage only:

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="sidebar-checkbox" id="sidebar-checkbox" {% if page.title =="Home" %}checked{% endif %}>
```
